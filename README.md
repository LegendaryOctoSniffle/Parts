# Parts

I'll refer to [this video](https://youtu.be/KroO4_xwKcs) to explain some of the parts that we'll be buying. Some of the parts and mechanisms will be different, but the basics will be the same.

Total cost will be around $300.

The goal for the first meeting will be to create a working sled drive, minus the 3D printed parts. In the video above, the sleds are the orange things moving up and down the square rails.

The printer in the video uses a belt drive: the sleds are attached to a belt which is turned by motors in the base of the printer. The printer that we're making won't be using a belt: it will use a heavy threaded rod that's specially designed for driving precision movements.

* T8x2 Leadscrew w/nut (400mm) (x1)
  This will be the threaded rod that will move each of our sleds up and down. We'll couple the motor to one end, and secure the length of the rod with a bearing that lets it turn freely. The x2 doesn't mean to buy 2 (yet), it designates the number of threads on the rod. [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/322001200138?var=510932183194)
* 8mm pillow block bearing. (x2)
  These are the bearings that will keep the rod aligned in place while letting it turn freely. Buy two. [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/2X-8mm-pillow-block-Self-aligning-bearing-mounted-support-3D-printer-CNC-Reprap-/322008974125). The linked item is a 2 pack: you can buy just one two pack.
* 2020 Aluminum Extrusion (600mm) (x1)
  A mainstay of 3D printer construction. You'll see why. We'll use these as the vertical supports for our printer, connecting its structural top and bottom. [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/322880737350)
* Stepper Motor (Nema17, 1.7A) (x1)
  Stepper motors are built for precise, strong movement. Nema is a common standard for sizing stepper motors, and there are various Nema sizes. Additionally, stepper motors are rated by amperage. We'll be using a 1.7A Nema17 motor. [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/321966121485)
* 5mm to 8mm shaft coupler (x1)
  These will couple the 5mm shaft of our drive motor to the 8mm leadscrew. [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/321966928277)
* 8mm by 400mm guide rod (x1)
  To drive our sled up and down, we'll mount it to the turning lead screw. But in order to keep the sled from turning, we'll need a second rod to guide it. [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/322454805576). We won't be making any other purchases from this seller, so I would recommend buying all three now.
* LM8UU 8mm linear bearing (x1)
  For our sled to slide up and down the guide rod, we'll need to equip it with a linear bearing. [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/141843551594) We won't be making any other purchases from this seller, so I would recommend buying all three now.
  
Most of the items that I've linked to are sold by Zyltech. We'll be making most of our subsequent purchases from Zyltech as well. Some of their items offer a combined shipping discount. If you want to take advantage of free shipping then you can order up to three of all of the items I've listed from Zyltech: we'll need them later.
